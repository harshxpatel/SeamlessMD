SeamlessMD Coding Assignment

Question 1:
Patient.json Changes
Line 2: Missing comma after “Patient”
Line 4: Missing { after “text”:
Line 8: Missing : after “identifier”, took away [ because it is not needed
Line 10: Removed “coding” object, as it was unnecessary 
Line 11: Missing comma after "htt://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203"
Line 14: Missing comma after "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.19.5"
Line 15: Took out double quotes from 12345, as it is a integer and can be used as data type INT
Line 16: Missing } to close “identifier” before comma
Line 18: Removed [ ] from “name”, as it was not needed for the object type (not a array)
Line 20: Removed [ ] from family and given names as they were not arrays
Line 23: Missing quotation mark after gender
Line 24: Missing comma after "2002-09-24"

Question 2:
Spot the Difference:
1.	Rope that is docking boat is missing in the top picture
2.	Color of contents in barrel at bottom left are different
3.	There is yellow hay missing between apple trees in top picture
4.	Number of tiles on roof of well are different in each picture
5.	One of the striped squares in middle is rotated in bottom picture
6.	2nd bush from left is missing a berry in top picture
7.	2nd sheep fox right is missing a ear in the top picture

The time it took me to find the differences was approximately 5 minutes. I started off by looking for any big differences in color between the 2 pictures. This is how I found the first 3 differences that I have listed. My strategy after this initial screen, was to start at the top left of the 2 pictures and scan them going from left to right looking for any extremely subtle differences. This is how I found 4 and 5 on my list of differences. Finally, I looked for objects that were grouped together or were in a cluster, to see if any of them were missing between the pictures. This is how I discovered the last 2 differences in my list.
